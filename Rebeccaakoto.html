        <p>
            I am Rebecca Osei Akoto, a third-year student in Ashesi majoring in management information systems.<br>
             I come from Bekwai in the Ashanti region. I am open-minded.<br> 
              I love learning new things and also goal-oriented. <br>
              After Ashesi that is 2022, I want to be one of the well-known business woman in the world.<br>
               I am interested in helping people, programming and business. 
               I see myself in a better place five years after my graduation in 2022
